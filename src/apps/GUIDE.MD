How to create a new app?

1. Create a new directory in the `apps` directory.
2. Create an index.tsx file in the new directory with a default export - This will be the entry
   point for the app.
3. (Optional) Creat a manifest.tsx file in the new directory to make visible in the launcher app and
   in the taskbar app.
